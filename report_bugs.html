<h2>Reporting Bugs</h2>

<p>
Please report any bugs you find in GOPchop at the
<a
href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=40120&atid=427109">SourceForge
Bug Tracker for GOPchop</a>.  If you wish, you may also join the 
<a
href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/gopchop-devel">GOPchop
Developer List</a> to discuss the problem more directly.
</p>

<p>
Your bug reports are vital for making GOPchop a robust and capable
application.  It is an important goal that each GOPchop release be
stable, crash-free, and behave itself well.  Bug reports from users are
the primary means of quality assurance, as we rely on the Open Source
principle of "Many Eyes Make Bugs Shallow".
</p>

<p>
If the bug you report to the bug tracker is not fixed promptly, this
may mean developers cannot reproduce it, or cannot understand your
description, or are simply too busy with other things. Be persistent. As
the original reporter, you are the person most interested in fixing it,
so if your first report had no effect, you must not let it drop. There
are many things you can do to help push your bug closer to a fix:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Submit the bug to the tracker. Don't wait for someone else to do
   it. It's important, otherwise your report will be quickly
   forgotten. (But check the tracker first, your bug may be already
   there.)
</li>

<li>
Submit complete information: version, platform, locale, steps to
reproduce, and sample file(s) and screenshots if appropriate.
</li>

<li>
If this is a crash, it's important to submit a backtrace. Use gdb to
get a backtrace as follows:

<pre>
 gdb <path to gopchop executable>

 (gdb) run [<i>parameters (optional)</i>]

 # Carry out the actions to make the program crash

 (gdb) bt
</pre>

and send us the output. All of this can be done on Windows too, the
Windows binary of gdb is available from
<a href="http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml">http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml</a>.
</li>

<li>If you really want the bug to be fixed, try to find out the exact
   point in time when the bug appeared. At the very least, test old
   GOPchop versions. To get a narrower and more useful estimate, use
   backdated CVS checkouts (the -D switch) to find the most recent date
   on which the CVS was is OK, and also the first date on which it is
   broken. Then we can make a diff between these two dates to figure out
   the reason. If you manage to find the day of breakage and if that
   day's diff is big (which is possible, given the rate of checkins
   we're having on average), try to narrow it down to a few hours. For
   example:

<pre>
  cvs -d:ext:<i>your_sf_login</i>@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/gopchop checkout -D"2004-04-04 12:00" gopchop
</pre>

will give you the CVS as it was on that date at midday. I think this
should work with anonymous CVS access too.
