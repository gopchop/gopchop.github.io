<h2>Fast Graphical Editor for MPEG2 Video Files</h2>

<p>
GOPchop is an open source tool for losslessly cutting and merging
hardware-encoded MPEG2 video files.  It limits cuts to I-frames or
group-of-picture (GOP) boundaries, thereby preventing artifacts and
degradation of quality by not needing to re-encode.  GOP boundaries
occur frequently enough (especially at scene boundaries), that GOPchop's
method is quite suitable for many applications.  It tends to be most handy
for people working with streams created by hardware encoders.
</p>

<p>
GOPchop is useful for:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Trimming recordings to desired start/end times.</li>
  <li> Extracting short clips from longer recordings.</li>
  <li> Editing commercials out of recorded TV programs.</li>
  <li> Splitting .VOB files from dual-layer DVD rips so the content 
       can be put on each side of a single-layer DVD-R.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.1.6 Released</h3>
<p><b>Apr 30, 2005</b> -
The long overdue development cycle release of GOPchop is finally here!
This version improves the UI, adds additional parsing support for certain
kinds of stream elements, fixes several compilation bugs, adds options for
system header injection/removal, and uses a more
hardy picture display system, which will always display the final picture
of a GOP.  The goal is to close in on a 1.2.0 stable release within the next
week so that several of the patch bundles recently sent to the
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gopchop-devel">gopchop-devel</a>
mailing list can get some development attention.

<h3>New Website</h3>
<p><b>Apr 29, 2005</b> -
As part of the preparations for the next 1.1.4 release, we've set up a
new website.  Hope ya like it.  The PHP is mercilessly stolen from the
<a href="http://www.inkscape.org">Inkscape</a> project.  ;-)  Huge thanks go
to Bryce Harrington.
